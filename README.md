This branch serves as a basic implementation example for integrating the Android SDK's UI into a newly created empty project. It is intended to demonstrate a simple and minimalistic approach for incorporating the SDK's features without additional complexity.

### Purpose
* To showcase how to set up and integrate the Android SDK UI into a clean, empty Android project.
* To provide a clear and straightforward reference for developers who are new to the SDK or wish to understand its core UI integration quickly.
* To act as a testing ground for verifying SDK functionality in its most basic configuration.
